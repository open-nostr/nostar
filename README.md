Nostar, a combination of "Nostr" and "AR(AO)," may not be the best name, but it represents a significant evolution in our protocol.

Our team has been working on the Nostr protocol for about a year. We've discovered that the client-relay model can sometimes be unstable, leading to data synchronization issues. For a long time, we've been contemplating how to integrate a consensus layer into Nostr.

Thanks to AO, we can now spawn processes and load relay logic onto them. The advantages of this approach include:

Permanent event storage.
Enhanced relay capabilities. For instance, relays can outsource keyword searches to search engines operating on AO.
Improved event ordering, as SU can order events instead of relying on sender timestamps.
These are just a few benefits. We can even develop a client on AO.

Nostr as a data processing protocol combined with AO as infrastructure is a game-changer!
